Assignment D

I made a 90 second song to accompany the visuals that i made using processing. The concept of the piece was inspired by changing frames and moving patterns. I wanted a very minimalistic concept so i used black and white as my colours. I created a total of 4 different states that i controlled using mouse press. I started this project by developing a few different states, and my first state was based off my assignment b. In experimenting with working with how formulas affect the generation of objects in a 3D environment, i created the 2nd and 3rd states.I created a static object as my 4th state. but i wanted to view it from a different angle, so using sphere detail as my main code, i positioned  the camera within the sphere and made it rotate. I also created an alternative version with inverted colours. One of the struggles i had was animating the rest of the objects in my other states. i decided to use peasy cam as a soloution. those states that didnt have to move like the first and fourth states, i fixed the camera position. I controlled all the states using keypress.
